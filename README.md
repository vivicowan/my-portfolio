# My Portfolio>
  
## Description
- For this task, I wanted to make a professional porfolio that would showcase a candidate's work experience to potential employers. 
- I built this portfolio to gain a better understanding of CSS properties. It takes a lot of effort to make a decent website, but I was willing to go beyond that to make a well presented portfolio. 
- This portfolio project solved the question of whether I am interested in web design as a career. The answer is yes, even though it cna be painful. 
- In this task, I learned many things that dealt with HTML and CSS. I think that this project gave me a better grasp on the more commonly used CSS methods for building a webpage. This task gave me the practice I needed.
